Gitleaks is a SAST tool for **detecting** and **preventing** hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos. Gitleaks is an **easy-to-use, all-in-one solution** for detecting secrets, past or present, in your code.

```
➜  ~/code(master) gitleaks detect --source . -v

## Getting Started

Gitleaks can be installed using Homebrew, Docker, or Go. Gitleaks is also available in binary form for many popular platforms and OS types on the [releases page](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/releases). In addition, Gitleaks can be implemented as a pre-commit hook directly in your repo or as a GitHub action using [Gitleaks-Action](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action).

### Installing

```bash
# MacOS
brew install gitleaks

# Docker (DockerHub)
docker pull zricethezav/gitleaks:latest
docker run -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest [COMMAND] --source="/path" [OPTIONS]

# Docker (ghcr.io)
docker pull ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:latest
docker run -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:latest [COMMAND] --source="/path" [OPTIONS]

# From Source (make sure `go` is installed)
git clone https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks.git
cd gitleaks
make build
```

### GitHub Action

Check out the official [Gitleaks GitHub Action](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action)

```
name: gitleaks
on: [pull_request, push, workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  scan:
    name: gitleaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITLEAKS_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.GITLEAKS_LICENSE}} # Only required for Organizations, not personal accounts.
```

### Pre-Commit

1. Install pre-commit from https://pre-commit.com/#install
2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of your repository with the following content:

   ```
   repos:
     - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
       rev: v8.16.1
       hooks:
         - id: gitleaks
   ```

   for a [native execution of GitLeaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/releases) or use the [`gitleaks-docker` pre-commit ID](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml) for executing GitLeaks using the [official Docker images](#docker)

3. Auto-update the config to the latest repos' versions by executing `pre-commit autoupdate`
4. Install with `pre-commit install`
5. Now you're all set!

```
➜ git commit -m "this commit contains a secret"
Detect hardcoded secrets.................................................Failed
```

Note: to disable the gitleaks pre-commit hook you can prepend `SKIP=gitleaks` to the commit command
and it will skip running gitleaks

```
➜ SKIP=gitleaks git commit -m "skip gitleaks check"
Detect hardcoded secrets................................................Skipped
```

### Commands

There are two commands you will use to detect secrets; `detect` and `protect`.

#### Detect

The `detect` command is used to scan repos, directories, and files. This command can be used on developer machines and in CI environments.

When running `detect` on a git repository, gitleaks will parse the output of a `git log -p` command (you can see how this executed
[here](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/7240e16769b92d2a1b137c17d6bf9d55a8562899/git/git.go#L17-L25)).
[`git log -p` generates patches](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_generating_patch_text_with_p) which gitleaks will use to detect secrets.
You can configure what commits `git log` will range over by using the `--log-opts` flag. `--log-opts` accepts any option for `git log -p`.
For example, if you wanted to run gitleaks on a range of commits you could use the following command: `gitleaks detect --source . --log-opts="--all commitA..commitB"`.
See the `git log` [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) for more information.

You can scan files and directories by using the `--no-git` option.

If you want to run only specific rules you can do so by using the `--enable-rule` option (with a rule ID as a parameter), this flag can be used multiple times. For example: `--enable-rule=atlassian-api-token` will only apply that rule. You can find a list of rules [here](config/gitleaks.toml).

#### Protect

The `protect` command is used to scan uncommitted changes in a git repo. This command should be used on developer machines in accordance with
[shifting left on security](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-shifting-left-on-security).
When running `protect` on a git repository, gitleaks will parse the output of a `git diff` command (you can see how this executed
[here](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/7240e16769b92d2a1b137c17d6bf9d55a8562899/git/git.go#L48-L49)). You can set the
`--staged` flag to check for changes in commits that have been `git add`ed. The `--staged` flag should be used when running Gitleaks
as a pre-commit.

**NOTE**: the `protect` command can only be used on git repos, running `protect` on files or directories will result in an error message.

### Creating a baseline

When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline,
gitleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any gitleaks report. To create a gitleaks report, run gitleaks with the `--report-path` parameter.

```
gitleaks detect --report-path gitleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called gitleaks-report.json
```

Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:

```
gitleaks detect --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json
```

After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.

### Verify Findings

You can verify a finding found by gitleaks using a `git log` command.
Example output:

```
Finding:     aws_secret="AKIAIMNOJVGFDXXXE4OA"
RuleID:      aws-access-token
Secret       AKIAIMNOJVGFDXXXE4OA
Entropy:     3.65
File:        checks_test.go
Line:        37
Commit:      ec2fc9d6cb0954fb3b57201cf6133c48d8ca0d29
Author:      Zachary Rice
Email:       z@email.com
Date:        2018-01-28T17:39:00Z
Fingerprint: ec2fc9d6cb0954fb3b57201cf6133c48d8ca0d29:checks_test.go:aws-access-token:37
```

We can use the following format to verify the leak:

```
git log -L {StartLine,EndLine}:{File} {Commit}
```

So in this example it would look like:

```
git log -L 37,37:checks_test.go ec2fc9d6cb0954fb3b57201cf6133c48d8ca0d29
```

Which gives us:

## Pre-Commit hook

You can run Gitleaks as a pre-commit hook by copying the example `pre-commit.py` script into
your `.git/hooks/` directory.

## Configuration

Gitleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:

```toml
# Title for the gitleaks configuration file.
title = "Gitleaks title"

# Extend the base (this) configuration. When you extend a configuration
# the base rules take precedence over the extended rules. I.e., if there are
# duplicate rules in both the base configuration and the extended configuration
# the base rules will override the extended rules.
# Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain together
# multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are appended
# and can contain duplicates.
# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the base configuration with the default gitleaks config:
# https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can supply a path to a configuration. Path is relative to where gitleaks
# was invoked, not the location of the base config.
path = "common_config.toml"

# An array of tables that contain information that define instructions
# on how to detect secrets
[[rules]]

# Unique identifier for this rule
id = "awesome-rule-1"

# Short human readable description of the rule.
description = "awesome rule 1"

# Golang regular expression used to detect secrets. Note Golang's regex engine
# does not support lookaheads.
regex = '''one-go-style-regex-for-this-rule'''

# Golang regular expression used to match paths. This can be used as a standalone rule or it can be used
# in conjunction with a valid `regex` entry.
path = '''a-file-path-regex'''

# Array of strings used for metadata and reporting purposes.
tags = ["tag","another tag"]

# Int used to extract secret from regex match and used as the group that will have
# its entropy checked if `entropy` is set.
secretGroup = 3

# Float representing the minimum shannon entropy a regex group must have to be considered a secret.
entropy = 3.5

# Keywords are used for pre-regex check filtering. Rules that contain
# keywords will perform a quick string compare check to make sure the
# keyword(s) are in the content being scanned. Ideally these values should
# either be part of the idenitifer or unique strings specific to the rule's regex
# (introduced in v8.6.0)
keywords = [
  "auth",
  "password",
  "token",
]

# You can include an allowlist table for a single rule to reduce false positives or ignore commits
# with known/rotated secrets
[rules.allowlist]
description = "ignore commit A"
commits = [ "commit-A", "commit-B"]
paths = [
  '''go\.mod''',
  '''go\.sum'''
]
# note: (rule) regexTarget defaults to check the _Secret_ in the finding.
# if regexTarget is not specified then _Secret_ will be used.
# Acceptable values for regexTarget are "match" and "line"
regexTarget = "match"
regexes = [
  '''process''',
  '''getenv''',
]
# note: stopwords targets the extracted secret, not the entire regex match
# like 'regexes' does. (stopwords introduced in 8.8.0)
stopwords = [
  '''client''',
  '''endpoint''',
]


# This is a global allowlist which has a higher order of precedence than rule-specific allowlists.
# If a commit listed in the `commits` field below is encountered then that commit will be skipped and no
# secrets will be detected for said commit. The same logic applies for regexes and paths.
[allowlist]
description = "global allow list"
commits = [ "commit-A", "commit-B", "commit-C"]
paths = [
  '''gitleaks\.toml''',
  '''(.*?)(jpg|gif|doc)'''
]

# note: (global) regexTarget defaults to check the _Secret_ in the finding.
# if regexTarget is not specified then _Secret_ will be used.
# Acceptable values for regexTarget are "match" and "line"
regexTarget = "match"

regexes = [
  '''219-09-9999''',
  '''078-05-1120''',
  '''(9[0-9]{2}|666)-\d{2}-\d{4}''',
]
# note: stopwords targets the extracted secret, not the entire regex match
# like 'regexes' does. (stopwords introduced in 8.8.0)
stopwords = [
  '''client''',
  '''endpoint''',
]
```

Refer to the default [gitleaks config](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml) for examples or follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to the default configuration. Additionally, you can check out [this gitleaks blog post](https://blog.gitleaks.io/stop-leaking-secrets-configuration-2-3-aeed293b1fbf) which covers advanced configuration setups.

### Additional Configuration

#### gitleaks:allow

If you are knowingly committing a test secret that gitleaks will catch you can add a `gitleaks:allow` comment to that line which will instruct gitleaks
to ignore that secret. Ex:

```
class CustomClass:
    discord_client_secret = '8dyfuiRyq=vVc3RRr_edRk-fK__JItpZ'  #gitleaks:allow

```

#### .gitleaksignore

You can ignore specific findings by creating a `.gitleaksignore` file at the root of your repo. In release v8.10.0 Gitleaks added a `Fingerprint` value to the Gitleaks report. Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret. Add this fingerprint to the `.gitleaksignore` file to ignore that specific secret. See Gitleaks' [.gitleaksignore](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/.gitleaksignore) for an example. Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.

## Exit Codes

You can always set the exit code when leaks are encountered with the --exit-code flag. Default exit codes below:

```
0 - no leaks present
1 - leaks or error encountered
126 - unknown flag
```
