# Go shared library (CGO)

This folder builds `gitleaks` as a C-compatible shared library.

Build examples (from repo root):

- Windows (MSYS/Git Bash):
  - `go build -buildmode=c-shared -o build/out/libgitleaks.dll ./cgo`
- Linux:
  - `go build -buildmode=c-shared -o build/out/libgitleaks.so ./cgo`
- macOS:
  - `go build -buildmode=c-shared -o build/out/libgitleaks.dylib ./cgo`

The build produces:
- `libgitleaks.*` (shared library)
- `libgitleaks.h` (C header generated by Go)
